# ðŸ¦’ðŸ’¨ Giraffe Spam Crusher: Advanced Spam Mitigation Bot for Telegram

## Overview

Giraffe Spam Crusher is a sophisticated Telegram bot designed for efficient spam detection and mitigation in channels and groups. It leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to identify and neutralize spam content with high accuracy.

## Key Features

- Utilizes advanced natural language processing models from OpenAI or Anthropic for message analysis
- Implements user tracking mechanisms to optimize processing efficiency
- Provides configurable spam sensitivity thresholds
- Supports retrospective analysis of message history in existing groups
- Offers channel-specific targeting capabilities
- Generates comprehensive operational statistics

## Operational Workflow
 
1. **New User Monitoring:** Focuses analysis on messages from recent group joiners
2. **AI-Powered Analysis:** Employs machine learning models for precise spam classification
3. **Flexible Configuration:** Allows fine-tuning of detection parameters
4. **Proactive Mitigation:** Executes automated spam removal or flagging based on analysis results
5. **Historical Processing:** Capable of analyzing pre-existing group messages
6. **Selective Deployment:** Operates exclusively within designated channels
   
## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ailabhub/giraffe-spam-crasher.git
   cd giraffe-spam-crasher
   ```

2. Configure the bot by creating a `.env` file with the following parameters:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   HISTORY=/root/result.json
   PROMPT=/root/prompt.txt
   MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
   PROVIDER=anthropic
   SPAM_THRESHOLD=0.6
   NEW_USER_THRESHOLD=1
   WHITELIST_CHANNELS=
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```

 3. On first launch, export the chat history to a file named results.json.

## Deployment Instructions

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system, then:

1. Initialize the bot:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Monitor bot operations:
   ```
   docker-compose logs -f bot
   ```

3. Terminate the bot:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Advanced Configuration

The `.env` file supports the following customizable parameters:

- `HISTORY`: Specifies the message history file location
- `PROMPT`: Defines AI instruction set
- `MODEL`: Selects the AI model for analysis
- `PROVIDER`: Toggles between OpenAI and Anthropic services
- `SPAM_THRESHOLD`: Adjusts spam detection sensitivity (range: 0-1)
- `NEW_USER_THRESHOLD`: Sets the message count threshold for "new user" classification
- `WHITELIST_CHANNELS`: Enumerates permitted channels
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls logging verbosity

## Architectural Overview

Giraffe Spam Crusher is composed of three primary modules:
- `ai`: Handles AI model interactions
- `bot`: Manages Telegram API communications
- `history`: Facilitates message data persistence
