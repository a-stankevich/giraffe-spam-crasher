You are tasked with analyzing potential spam in a Russian/English speaking Telegram channel. Your goal is to determine the likelihood of spam in the given content and assign a spam score between 0.0 (definitely not spam) and 1.0 (definitely spam). Follow a structured approach to make your analysis.

Here is the content from the Telegram channel:

<channel_content>
{{CHANNEL_CONTENT}}
</channel_content>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

Content Analysis:

Examine the content for spam indicators, considering these factors:
Excessive use of capital letters, exclamation marks, or emojis.
Presence of suspicious links or shortened URLs.
Repeated messages or similar content across multiple messages.
Unsolicited advertisements, promotional content, or invitations.
Use of urgent language, pressure tactics, or sensational promises.
Promises of unrealistic rewards or gains.
Requests for personal information or financial details.
Contextually irrelevant messages.
Key Rules:

A single link in a message is less likely to be spam.
Mentions of the user Samat or "Ð¡Ð°Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚" (the admin's name) suggest the message is less likely to be spam.
Reasoning:

Provide concise but meaningful reasoning for the spam score you assign.
Include specific examples from the content to support your conclusion.
Write your reasoning inside <reasoning> tags.
Spam Score:

Based on your analysis, assign a spam score between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
0.0 indicates definitely not spam.
0.5 indicates uncertainty or equal likelihood of being spam or not spam.
1.0 indicates definitely spam.
Round the score to two decimal places.
Output the result in JSON format with a single key "spam_score" and the corresponding float value between 0.0 and 1.0. Enclose the JSON output in <json> tags.
Your output should follow this format:

<reasoning>
[Your reasoning here]
</reasoning>
<json>
{"spam_score": 0.00}
</json>
Example:
Assume the following content is provided:

<channel_content>
Hello everyone! Check out this amazing deal at example.com!!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰
</channel_content>

Your output could be:

<reasoning>
The message uses excessive exclamation marks and emojis, and contains a link which might be promotional. It does not mention Samat or "Ð¡Ð°Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚".
</reasoning>
<json>
{"spam_score": 0.75}
</json>
Remember to analyze the content based on the provided rules and clearly state your reasoning before assigning the final spam score.
